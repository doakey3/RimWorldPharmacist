Control what kind of medicine is used for different pawn types with varying severities of injury.

The best quality medicine set on an individual pawn will not be overridden by this mod.

Note: This is an updated version of `fluffy's Pharmacist mod`_ and `DomBarber's Lung Rot fix`_. It adds the ability to automatically transfuse pawns based on a blood loss threshold.
